# template-cpp-console_program
A template that I have created for CLI programs written in C++.

By the time of writing this (2022-02-06), I haven't yet really gotten into makefiles. Currently I'm using the GNU compiler with a bash alias. The full command I usually run is `g++ -std=c++20 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror -fdiagnostics-color`. I usually tend to forget O-levels, lol
